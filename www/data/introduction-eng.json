This is a Kannada poem extolling Vayu Devaru and his three incarnations. It follows the structure of Shri Hari-Vayu Sthuthi and was composed by Shripadarajaru for the benefit of those who don\u0027t know Sanskrit and / or are not allowed to recite the Vayu-Sthuthi.\n                         \u003cbr/\u003e  In this short but potent work Shripadarajaru has not only captured the essence of the Shri Hari-Vayu Sthuthi but also embedded several key, and not so well known concepts, as well as incidents from Ramayana and Mahabharata. One has to remember that Shripadarajaru was an amsha of Dhruva, an aparoksha gyani, a very great scholar and the vidya-guru of Shri Vyasaraja. So, his description of Vayu Devaru and his three incarnations, is bound to be complete and flawless. The fact that another great aparoksha gyani - Shri Jagannatha dasaru has written the phala-Sthuthi of this work is a testimony to its potence and greatness.\n                    "},{"title":"Credits for this translation","text":"\n                        There are several patantaras of the stotra.
